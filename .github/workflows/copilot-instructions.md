Importing and exporting
Use only box::use for imports. Using library and :: is forbidden.

box::use statement (if needed) should be located at the top of the file.

There can be two box::use statements per file. First one should include only R packages, second should only import other scripts.

Imports in box::use should be sorted alphabetically.

Using [...] is forbidden.

All external functions in a script should be imported. This includes operators, like %>%.

A script should only import functions that it uses.

Ways of importing
There are two ways a package or a script can be imported:

List imported functions - functions imported are listed in []
box::use(
  dplyr[filter],
)

filter(mtcars, cyl > 4)
Use it if there are no more than 8 functions imported from this package/script.

Import package and access functions with $
box::use(
  dplyr,
)
dplyr$filter(mtcars, cyl > 4)
When moving function into a different script, remember to adjust imports in box::use:

Add import for all required functions to the file where you moved the function.
Make sure to follow the correct way of importing (direct or using $) in the new file. Modify it if needed.
Remove redundant imports from the original file.
Import the moved function in the original file.
Use it if there are more than 8 functions imported from this package/script.

Exporting
If a function is used only inside a script, it should not be exported.

If a function is used by other scripts, it should be exported by adding #' @export before the function.

Rhino modules
When creating a new module in app/view, use the template:

box::use(
  shiny[moduleServer, NS]
)

#' @export
ui <- function(id) {
  ns <- NS(id)

}

#' @export
server <- function(id) {
  moduleServer(id, function(input, output, session) {

  })
}
Unit tests
All R unit tests are located in tests/testthat.

There should be only one test file per script, named test-{script name}.R.

If testing private functions (ones that are not exported), use this pattern:

box::use(app/logic/mymod)

impl <- attr(mymod, "namespace")

test_that('{test description}', {
    expect_true(impl$this_works())
})
Testing exported and non-exported functions
When testing a box module that contains both exported and non-exported functions:

Import the entire module without specifying individual functions:
box::use(
  app/logic/mymodule,
)
Access exported functions using the module name with $:
test_that("exported function works", {
  expect_equal(mymodule$exported_function(1), 2)
})
For testing non-exported functions, get the module’s namespace at the start of the test file:
impl <- attr(mymodule, "namespace")

test_that("non-exported function works", {
  expect_equal(impl$internal_function(1), 2)
})
This pattern allows testing both public and private functions while maintaining proper encapsulation.
