This application is a replacement for the PastRx(R) software. <br>
It provides an interactive web-based interface that offers additional functionalities.


When saving your files, two files are created: a `.mb2` file and a `.json` file.
- When loading data we recommend to always use the `.json` file if available.
- However,  If the `.json` file is not found or cannot be loaded properly, you can always load the `.mb2` file instead.

While the `.mb2` file remains like the original PastRx file, the `.json` file contains additional information to ensure full functionality when loading the data back into the application.

Further information are available in the documentation section of the application.

> **Note:** The application don't record data. The file and any information provided is stored locally on your computer only when you save the patient data.
